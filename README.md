Hello, my name is Knyshov Vladislav. I am a novice developer, worked a lot with html/css/js, react/react-native. Now I'm learning hard to become a super web developer.

## :point_right: Skills:
- :white_check_mark: JS, CSS & HTML (including semantic html & css3);
- :white_check_mark: React, Redux, React-router, React-hooks & React-context;
- :white_check_mark: JS libraries such as jQuery or Axios;
- :white_check_mark: Vue, Vuex & Vue router;
- :white_check_mark: NodeJs, Express & MongoDB (little experience);
- :white_check_mark: PHP (enough to work with Wordpress);
