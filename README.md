# Vladislav Knyshow | @imnotoriginal

Hello, my name is Knyshov Vladislav. I am a novice developer, worked a lot with html/css/js, react/react-native. I already have a little experience in the IT field, but I do not plan to stop there.

## Now I know
- JS, CSS & HTML (including semantic html & css3);
- React, Redux, React-router, React-hooks & React-context;
- JS libraries such as jQuery or Axios;
- Vue, Vuex & Vue router (little experience);
- NodeJs, Express & MongoDB (little experience);
- PHP (little experience);
- Quickly learning new technologies;
- I can find information on the Internet without distracting senior developers in no small part
